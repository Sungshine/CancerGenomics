Hello. -Adele

// To run in command line
// Compile the knitr figures, replace "reportv1.Rnw" with your Rnw file

$ R -e 'library(knitr);knit("reportv1.Rnw")'  // will output a .tex file to be used as input in next step

// Compile LaTeX pdf document and knit together with R figures/images
// \myvar is declared to be used as the report header under "patient name"

$ pdflatex "\def\myvar{688.tsv} \input{reportv1.tex}"

Do not forget to change the absolute paths to the banner images contained within the repo.
There is a result file named 688.tsv to be used to make sure the tables are generating correctly in the LaTeX pdf.
